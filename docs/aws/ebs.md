**Setting Up a Persistent Development Machine on AWS with Terraform**

To set up a development machine on AWS that you can start and stop to save costs while ensuring persistent storage, you need to:

1. **Use Amazon EBS Volumes for Persistent Storage**
2. **Configure Terraform to Manage the Instance and EBS Volumes**
3. **Ensure Volumes are Mounted and Unmounted on Start/Stop**

Here's a step-by-step guide to help you achieve this:

---

### **1. Use Amazon EBS Volumes for Persistent Storage**

**Why EBS Volumes?**

- **Persistence:** EBS volumes are network-attached storage that persists independently of the life of an instance.
- **Flexibility:** You can attach and detach EBS volumes from instances as needed.
- **Data Safety:** Data on EBS volumes remains intact when you stop and start your instance.

**Key Points:**

- **Root EBS Volume:**
  - By default, the root volume of an EC2 instance is an EBS volume.
  - Ensure the `DeleteOnTermination` attribute is set to `false` if you want the root volume to persist after instance termination (not just stop/start).

- **Additional EBS Volumes:**
  - You can add extra EBS volumes for storing data separately from the OS.

---

### **2. Configure Terraform to Manage the Instance and EBS Volumes**

**Terraform Configuration Overview**

Your Terraform configuration will define:

- The EC2 instance.
- The EBS volumes.
- The mounting of the EBS volumes.
- Start/stop mechanisms (if automating with AWS services).

**Sample Terraform Configuration:**

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"  # Replace with your preferred region
}

resource "aws_instance" "dev_machine" {
  ami                    = "ami-12345678"   # Replace with your desired AMI ID
  instance_type          = "t3.medium"      # Choose an instance type suitable for development
  key_name               = "your-key-pair"  # Replace with your key pair name

  # Configure the root EBS volume
  root_block_device {
    volume_size           = 30              # Size in GB
    volume_type           = "gp3"           # General Purpose SSD
    delete_on_termination = false           # Persist root volume after termination
  }

  # Add an additional EBS volume
  ebs_block_device {
    device_name           = "/dev/sdf"      # Device name in the instance
    volume_size           = 50              # Size in GB
    volume_type           = "gp3"
    delete_on_termination = false
  }

  # Security Group to allow SSH access
  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.dev_sg.id]

  tags = {
    Name = "DevMachine"
  }
}

# Security Group for SSH access
resource "aws_security_group" "dev_sg" {
  name        = "dev_machine_sg"
  description = "Security group for development machine"
  vpc_id      = "vpc-abcdef123"  # Replace with your VPC ID

  ingress {
    description = "SSH"
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["your-ip-address/32"]  # Replace with your IP
  }

  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}

# Elastic IP to maintain consistent public IP
resource "aws_eip" "dev_eip" {
  vpc                       = true
  instance                  = aws_instance.dev_machine.id
  associate_with_private_ip = aws_instance.dev_machine.private_ip
}
```

**Important Details:**

- **AMI ID:** Replace `"ami-12345678"` with the ID of the AMI you want to use (e.g., Ubuntu, Amazon Linux).
- **Key Pair:** Replace `"your-key-pair"` with the name of your AWS key pair.
- **Security Group:** Update the `cidr_blocks` with your public IP address to secure SSH access.
- **VPC ID:** Replace `"vpc-abcdef123"` with your actual VPC ID.
- **Elastic IP:** Attaching an Elastic IP ensures your instance retains the same public IP after stop/start cycles.

### **3. Ensure Volumes are Mounted and Unmounted on Start/Stop**

**Mounting EBS Volumes on Instance Start**

By default, the root EBS volume is automatically mounted at `/` when the instance starts. However, additional EBS volumes need to be mounted manually or via automation.

**Steps to Mount the Additional EBS Volume:**

1. **Connect to Your Instance via SSH:**

   ```bash
   ssh -i /path/to/your-key-pair.pem ec2-user@your-elastic-ip
   ```

2. **List Block Devices:**

   ```bash
   lsblk
   ```

   You should see `/dev/xvdf` (the additional EBS volume) listed.

3. **Format the Volume (First Time Only):**

   ```bash
   sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf
   ```

   **Note:** Only format the volume the first time. Formatting will erase all data on the volume.

4. **Create a Mount Point:**

   ```bash
   sudo mkdir /mnt/data
   ```

5. **Mount the Volume:**

   ```bash
   sudo mount /dev/xvdf /mnt/data
   ```

6. **Update `/etc/fstab` for Automatic Mounting:**

   - Get the UUID of the volume:

     ```bash
     sudo blkid /dev/xvdf
     ```

     Output example:

     ```
     /dev/xvdf: UUID="abcd1234-ef56-7890-abcd-1234567890ab" TYPE="ext4"
     ```

   - Edit `/etc/fstab`:

     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/fstab
     ```

     Add the following line at the end (replace with your actual UUID):

     ```
     UUID=abcd1234-ef56-7890-abcd-1234567890ab /mnt/data ext4 defaults,nofail 0 2
     ```

   - Save and exit the editor.

7. **Test the `/etc/fstab` Entry:**

   ```bash
   sudo umount /mnt/data
   sudo mount -a
   ```

   Verify that the volume is mounted again.

**Unmounting EBS Volumes on Instance Stop**

When you stop an EC2 instance, the system gracefully unmounts file systems. However, to ensure data integrity:

- **Flush File System Buffers:**

  ```bash
  sudo sync
  ```

- **Unmount the Volume (Optional):**

  ```bash
  sudo umount /mnt/data
  ```

  **Note:** This is generally not necessary when stopping the instance via AWS APIs or the console, as the OS handles it.

---

### **4. Automate Mounting with User Data (Optional)**

To automate the mounting process, especially useful if you recreate the instance or use auto-scaling, you can use the `user_data` field in your Terraform configuration.

**Add to your `aws_instance` Resource:**

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "dev_machine" {
  # ... existing configuration ...

  user_data = <<-EOF
    #!/bin/bash
    if [ ! -e /dev/xvdf1 ]; then
      mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf
    fi
    mkdir -p /mnt/data
    mount -t ext4 /dev/xvdf /mnt/data
    UUID=$(blkid -s UUID -o value /dev/xvdf)
    grep -q "$UUID" /etc/fstab || echo "UUID=$UUID /mnt/data ext4 defaults,nofail 0 2" >> /etc/fstab
  EOF
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Check if Volume is Formatted:**

  ```bash
  if [ ! -e /dev/xvdf1 ]; then
    mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf
  fi
  ```

  This ensures `mkfs` is only run if the volume is not already formatted.

- **Mount the Volume and Update `/etc/fstab`:**

  The script mounts the volume and adds an entry to `/etc/fstab` if it doesn't already exist.

---

### **5. Start and Stop the Instance Using Terraform**

**Start the Instance:**

- Run `terraform apply` to create and start your instance.

**Stop the Instance:**

- Terraform does not natively handle stopping instances. You can use the AWS CLI or AWS SDKs to stop the instance when not in use.

  ```bash
  aws ec2 stop-instances --instance-ids $(terraform output -raw dev_machine_id)
  ```

**Automate Stop/Start (Optional):**

- **AWS Instance Scheduler:** Use AWS Instance Scheduler to automatically stop/start instances based on a schedule.
- **Lambda Functions:** Write a Lambda function triggered by CloudWatch Events to stop the instance at specific times.

**Important Considerations:**

- **Data Persistence:** When you stop an instance, the EBS volumes remain attached and data is preserved.
- **Costs:** You are not billed for instance usage when it's stopped, but you are billed for EBS storage.
- **IP Address:** If not using an Elastic IP, the public IP changes after stop/start cycles.

---

### **6. Ensure Security and Connectivity**

**Security Group Configuration:**

- Ensure that the security group allows SSH access from your IP.

**Elastic IP Address:**

- By associating an Elastic IP with your instance, you maintain the same public IP address even after stop/start cycles.

**Update Terraform Configuration:**

If you need to allow access from different IPs or need to adjust security settings, update your Terraform configuration and re-apply.

---

### **7. Additional Tips and Best Practices**

**Backups and Snapshots:**

- Regularly create snapshots of your EBS volumes for data backup.
- Use Terraform to manage snapshot resources if needed.

**Monitoring and Alerts:**

- Set up CloudWatch alarms to monitor instance metrics (CPU, memory, disk usage).
- Receive notifications if thresholds are crossed.

**Cost Management:**

- Review AWS billing to understand costs associated with EBS storage and Elastic IPs.
- Use AWS Budgets to set alerts for unexpected charges.

**Instance Profiles and IAM Roles:**

- If your development work requires AWS API access, assign an IAM role to the instance.
- Manage IAM roles and policies via Terraform.

---

### **Summary**

To set up a cost-effective development machine on AWS with persistent storage:

- **Use EBS Volumes:** Ensure all data is stored on EBS volumes, which persist independently of the instance.
- **Configure with Terraform:** Define your infrastructure as code for consistency and repeatability.
- **Mount EBS Volumes:** Automate the mounting process to ensure volumes are accessible after start/stop cycles.
- **Manage Start/Stop Cycles:** Use AWS tools or scripts to stop the instance when not in use, saving on compute costs.
- **Secure the Instance:** Configure security groups and use Elastic IPs to maintain secure and consistent access.
- **Monitor Costs and Usage:** Keep an eye on your AWS resources to optimize for cost and performance.

By following these steps, you'll have a development environment that is persistent, secure, and cost-efficient, allowing you to focus on your development tasks without worrying about data loss or unnecessary expenses.
